WHAT EXACTLY IS STATE ?
1. State is internal property of a component which can change 
2. Changing state rerenders the component
3. State is similar to "props", but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT "state" of a component
-> this.state.name = "hello" // this will not call render() function of component , so no re-render

-> Always use setState() as it tells react state gets changed and its needs to call render() of
"this" or current object

-> React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.

-> Also, since setState() automatically "merges a partial state" into the current state, 
we only needed to "call it with the changed parts".

-> Because this.props and this.state may be updated "asynchronously", you should not rely on their 
values for calculating the next state.(VVVV IMP)
