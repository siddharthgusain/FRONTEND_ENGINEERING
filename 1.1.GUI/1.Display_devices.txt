-> display is 2-d matrix of pixels , also known as frame in terms of GPU 
-> GPU the ASIC responsible for the frame computation and manipulating the pixels in the screen
-> GPU has its own memory , also known as frame buffers.
-> GUI is actually frames which also recomputed very fast that it appears to be interactive.
-> CPU is slow for this manipulation thats why an ASIC is made that is GPU to compute frames and interact 
with displays via drivers.
-> Graphics library are already built which contains genral things like drawing a line , circle etc,
E.g OPENGL, DIRECTX, VULKAN
-> GUI Programs gives rise to "asynchronous programs"(or EVENT DRIVEN) , as in GUI things are event based and event can 
happen anytime i.e not in sequence.
-> Right now GUI programs are predominant as they make human computer interaction easy.
-> For developers command line is still dominant.


-> In GUI based programs , user is in control of the events.
-> In CLI based programs , the program is in control of the events.
