-> Multithreading is a way of creating multiple light weight process(LWP) called threads.
-> Threads can be "user level" and "kernel level".
-> user level threads are managed by User library and kernel level threads are managed by OS.
-> Without multithreading , programs are executed in "serial order", i.e All the instructions
in the program is executed in the same order as they appear in Program.
-> Multithreading can give rise to some issues of synchronisation.
