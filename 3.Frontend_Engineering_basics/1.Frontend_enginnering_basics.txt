-> Every Front-end application has most things common either a mobile app or web app or desktop app
-> In Front end Engineering we basicaly take care of 4 things :-
1. Dividing the whole UI into managable components(Declarative i.e declare the UI using xml , html etc)
2. Managing lifecycle of components
3. Managing state of application(Data + Storage and passing data)
4. Navigation and Routing 

-> As a developer we only declare the UI using html or xml or any other markup langauge , how it is painted into pixels is 
taken care by browser and operating system.

-> We only define callbacks and attach it to UI nodes , but these callbacks are called by browser or operating system in
response to events and interrupts.

-> We as a developer decides how to pass and store data(Cookies,IndexDB,Localstorage etc) , how it is stored is done by browser
and operating system.

-> Developer job is more on the declarative side and how to architecure the source code for scalability and maintainability.
