-> Every Front-end application has most things common either a mobile app or web app or desktop app

-> In Front end Engineering we basicaly take care of 4 things :-
1. Dividing the whole UI into managable components(Declarative i.e declare the UI using xml , html etc)
2. Managing lifecycle of components
3. Managing state of application(Data + Storage and passing data between various UI components)
4. Navigation and Routing between screens

-> As a developer we only declare the UI using html or xml or any other markup language , how it is painted into pixels is 
taken care by browser and operating systemwith help of GPU and graphics API LIKE OPENGL

-> We only define callbacks and attach it to UI nodes , but these callbacks are called by browser or operating system in
response to events and interrupts.

-> We as a developer decides how to pass and store data(Cookies,IndexDB,Localstorage etc) , how it is stored is done by browser
and operating system.

-> Developer job is more on the "DECLARATIVE SIDE" and how to architecture the source code for scalability and maintainability.

-> Frontend is the product a user interacts with so the focus should be high on UI and UX along with performance of application.
-> Frontend application is what user sees i.e data consumed from API shown in displays and user interacts with the application by 
sending events that is handled by application with event handlers/callbacks.
