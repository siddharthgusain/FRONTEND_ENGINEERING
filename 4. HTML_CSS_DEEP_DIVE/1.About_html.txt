-> HTML stand for "Hyper Text Markup Langae"
-> HTML file is just a stream of characters
-> The structure of html tags is useful to "RENDERER PROCESS" to create DOM Data structure into 
RAM.
-> The structure of html helps developer to define the layout of page easily , in the end it is 
parsed by renderer process.
-> Html provides tags which are stored as Tree node inside RAM by renderer process
-> Each node has lots of properties which can be cascaded by CSS and each node can be 
accessed by Javascript using WEB API.
-> Each browser provides "default styling"[User agent stylesheet] for each tag which is supported by it.
-> Each tag is a "RECTANGLE"(box-model) which is rendered using OS and OPENGL library support.

NOTE:- HTML is like a "declarative" syntax where we declare what UI we want,what widget we want 
and what position on the screen , how that UI is drawn onto the screen is abstracted from 
developer by the Browser,OS, GPU and the whole graphics pipeline components.

-> In Android we have "XML" that declares the UI we want ,How it is drawn and compiled is
taken care by Android OS and GPU
