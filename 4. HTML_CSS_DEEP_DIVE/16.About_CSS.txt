-> Css stands for cascading style sheets
-> Why cascade name is given cuz is cacades/overwrites the default styling supplied by each browser
-> Css file is also parsed by renderer process (Blink) inside the main thread , that is Why
css is also render blocking resource.
-> Css parser is the code written inside Blink to parse css and apply to DOM nodes
-> Each node is a C++ object in Memory having giant object of key value pairs of css properties
that we overwrite.
