A little Recap :-
1. We have talked about how data is fetched and what are the physical infrastucture
and protocols that goes behind the scenes of fetching data from server

2. We have looked at a high level overview about how browser interprets html,css,js

3. We have talked about sychronous JS and how Instruction written in JS file is run line 
by line

4. We have talked about asynchronous JS and a little overview of EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING.

5. Before going deep into Asynchronous Behaviour , its important to learn behind the scenes
of a browser process

HOW BROWSER WORKS (BEHIND THE SCENES)?

1. HOW MANY PROCESSES ARE CREATED WHEN WE CLICK THE CHROME SHORTCUT
2. DETAIL ABOUT THE PROCESSES
3. HOW MULTIPROCESS ARCHITECTURE WORKS
4. WHAT ARE THE API EXPOSED BY BROWSER THAT CAN BE USED BY JS PROGRAM
5. CODE INSIDE BROWSER (AN OVERVIEW)

NOTE :- Browsers are usually written in languages like C/C++
Each part of a Browser is a program which interacts with OS using "system call" to 
access the hardware.

NOTE ABOUT OS :-
1. OS has program written to handle various things like:
    -> Network request
    -> I/O request(Keyboard , Mouse ,Monitor)
    -> Managing RAM and HDD
    -> Managing GPU 
    -> Interating with Device drivers
    -> Handling interrupts
    -> OS is the only software which directly access hardware.
    -> All other programs uses OS API to access hardware resources.
    
2. Browser Process accesses these resources using "system calls" 
-> Its an abstraction for developers or high level programmer
-> As a high level developer we just know which function to use from OS API ,
   How that function is implemented is hidden from us.

3. ABOUT HTML
-> HTML is just a Format that we as developer define to tell browser what to render
-> HTML FILE contains just a bunch of characters which collectively represents some syntax
-> All the heavy lifting is done by browser
-> We as a developer just define the syntax of what to do , how to do is figured out 
   by browser.

4. ABOUT CSS
-> CSS is also a format where developers define what to do 
-> To decrease the developement time Browsers are made they are kind of abstraction layer 
   which do the heavy lifting.

5. ABOUT JS
-> JS is also a bunch of intruction that we write in a file of what to do , how to do 
is done by browser using OS support .

-> JS Program interacts with Browser core API like Storage using API,in simple terms
some bunch of functions defined inside browser code and that can be called inside JS file

-> In the we should not forget that everything is a software and gets converted to Process

-> Interprocess communication is going on btw process.

5. ABOUT BROWSER
-> OLD browser were single process ARCHITECTURE
-> Modern Browser have MULTIPROCESS ARCHITECTURE(AlONG WITH "Multithreading")
