-> A module is a single JavaScript file that has some reasonable functionality.
-> A package is a "directory" with "one or more MODULES" inside of it and a package. json file 
which has metadata about the package
-> A package can be made available/open sourced by publishing it into some public registry like npm or yarn
-> Package are useful to get already available code to use (Reusing function).

-> In web ecosystem , we have a global package registry and to work with that registry we have
command line softwares like "NPM" and "yarn"

-> npm or yarn consists of three distinct components:

1. the website
2. the Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. the registry

NPM:- NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
YARN:- Yet Another Resource Negotiator (By facebook)-> faster than npm

-> ALL PACKAGES THAT WE INSTALL FROM REGISTERY ARE CREATED INSIDE "node_modules" i.e a gaint directory
containing packages and dependencies.

-> NEVER PUSH "node_modules" cuz to generate this directory , only package.json is required
-> package.json is json file containing meta data about the project like dependencies and other configs
and npm scripts
