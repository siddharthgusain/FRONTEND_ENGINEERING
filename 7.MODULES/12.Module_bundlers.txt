-> We have talked about some problems with native module support in browser
-> Also doing http request for each module can decrease the performance of website
-> SO there is need to bundle the JS modules into one or more bundled js file, this is solved by
module bundlers.

-> At its core, Module Bundlers is a "STATIC MODULE BUNDLER" for modern JavaScript applications. 
-> When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a "DEPENDENCY GRAPH" from one or 
more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, 
which are "STATIC ASSETS" to serve your content from.
->SO basically , these bundlers do bundling before sending to browser

VARIOUS FAMOUS MODULE BUNDLERS:-
1. Webpack 
2. Vite
3. Parcel
