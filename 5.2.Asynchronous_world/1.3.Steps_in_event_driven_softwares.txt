-> The first step in developing an event-driven program is to write a series of subroutines, or 
methods, called "EVENT HANDLERS routines. These routines handle the events to which the main program 
will respond. For example, a single left-button mouse-click on a command button in a GUI program may 
trigger a routine that will open another window, save data to a database or exit the application. 

Many modern-day programming environments provide the programmer with event templates, allowing the 
programmer to focus on writing the "EVENT HANDLERS"

-> The second step is to bind event handlers to events so that the correct function is called when 
the event takes place. 

-> Graphical editors combine the first two steps: double-click on a button,
and the editor creates an (empty) event handler associated with the user clicking the button and 
opens a text window so you can edit the event handler.

-> "The third step in developing an event-driven program is to write the main loop". This is a function
that checks for the occurrence of events, and then calls the matching event handler to process it. 

NOTE:- Most event-driven programming environments "ALREADY PROVIDE THIS EVENT LOOP", so it need not be 
specifically provided by the "APPLICATION PROGRAMMERS".
