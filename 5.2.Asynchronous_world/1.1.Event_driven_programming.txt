-> In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of 
the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs,
or "message passing from other programs or threads". 

->Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in "Graphical User Interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications)
that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input. 

-> This is also true of programming for device drivers (e.g., P in USB device driver stacks[1]).

-> In an event-driven application, there is generally a "MAIN LOOP" that listens for events and then 
triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected. 

-> In embedded systems, the same may be achieved using "HARDWARE INTERRUPTS" instead of a constantly running main loop. 

-> Event-driven programs can be written in any "PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, although the task is easier in 
languages that provide high-level abstractions, such as "AWAIT AND CLOSURES.

-> Events and event driven behaviour is possible with INFINITE LOOP(event loop) and INTERRUPTS with help
of OPERATING SYSTEM

-> Every GUI based software either android app , ios app , desktop app , web app all have "EVENT LOOP"
