-> Async await is just and syntactical sugar helpfull for developer to write clean code
-> Even though async function is written just like any other synchronous function
but behind the scenes they are implemented with "generators" and promises

-> All the statements below "await" statement becomes part of its callback

async function fetchTodo() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
          (  // Part of callback
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
            }
            const data = await response.json();
                (
                    // part of callback of second await statement
                    console.log(data);
                )
            )
    }
    catch (error) {
        console.error(`Could not get products: ${error}`);
    }
}
