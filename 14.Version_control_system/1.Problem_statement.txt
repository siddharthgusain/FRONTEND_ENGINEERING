-> Whenever we work on a project , we want to go back to previous version of project
in case we make a bad change, locally we can do it by ctrl+z which is only applicable
until the program is open 

-> Also in case more than 1 person is contributing to a project there is a need of tracking the changes
made by various contributors so that changes can be easily revertible.
