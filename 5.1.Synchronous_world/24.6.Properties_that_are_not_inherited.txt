var num = 10; // this is a variable/object 

-> "num" is object in javascript 
-> It should inherit from browser inbuilt object "Number"

-> It will be able to inherit only those properties that are definded in "Number.prototype".
-> "prototype" property of object is very usefull in creating polyfills which we will see in further sections.

-> Number object has lots of other properties like "Number.EPSILON" and "Number.isNAN" but these are not part of
"num" object that means they are not inherited.

-> Its very important to understand what is inherited and what is not.
