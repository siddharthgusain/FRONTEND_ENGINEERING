-> As react is a library , we can just put the JS files inside HTML and use its classes and functions
-> As the Web App grows its important to have a proper build/tool chain for:-
1. Scaling to many files and components.
2. Using third-party libraries from npm.
3. Detecting common mistakes early.
4. Live-editing CSS and JS in development.
5. Optimizing the output for production by bundlers like webpack.

1. CREATE_REACT_APP tool

-> Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend 
build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses 
"BABEL AND WEBPACK", but you don’t need to know anything about them.
