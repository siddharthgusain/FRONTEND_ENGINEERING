-> As react is a library , we can just put the JS files inside HTML and use its classes and functions
-> As the Web App grows its important to have a proper build/tool chain for:-
1. Scaling to many files and components.
2. Using third-party libraries from npm.
3. Detecting common mistakes early.
4. Live-editing CSS and JS in development.
5. Optimizing the output for production by bundlers like webpack.

------------------------CREATE_REACT_APP tool-------------------

-> Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend 
build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses 
"BABEL AND WEBPACK", but you don’t need to know anything about them.


A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

1. A "package manager", such as "Yarn or npm". It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, 
and easily install or update them.

2. A "bundler", such as "webpack or Parcel". It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small 
packages to optimize load time.

3. A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.
