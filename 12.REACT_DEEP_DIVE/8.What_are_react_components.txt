-> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece 
in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

-> Conceptually, components are like "JavaScript Functions". They accept arbitrary inputs 
(called “props”) and "return React elements" describing what should appear on the screen.

-> Props are immutable object 
-> Props are Read-Only
-> "All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props."
