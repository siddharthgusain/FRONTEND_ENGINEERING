->Any thing related to engineering is a build with the concept of abstraction.
->E.g :- Mobiles to user is an abstraction as they do not need to know how under the hood
it is working , they just know how to give input like from keyboard and gets output on screen,
how screen is working it is "abstracted: from user.
->As a developer it good to know how things work under the hood, but still learn things in absstraction as well
-> OS has created an abstraction for developers as well , we only need to know about system calls,
how OS does the work is abstracted inside the OS code.
