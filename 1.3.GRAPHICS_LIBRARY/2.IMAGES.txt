1. BITMAPPED IMAGE
-> The term "digital image" usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images 
-> Raster images have a finite set of digital values, called picture elements or pixels.
-> The digital image contains a fixed number of rows and columns of pixels. Pixels are the smallest 
individual element in an image, holding antiquated values that represent the brightness 
of a given color at any specific point.
-> Typically, the pixels are stored in computer memory as a raster image or raster map, 
a two-dimensional array of small integers.  These values are often transmitted or stored in a compressed form.
-> Raster images can be created by a variety of input devices and techniques, 
such as digital cameras. They can also be synthesized from arbitrary non-image data, 
such as mathematical functions or three-dimensional geometric models; 
the latter being a major sub-area of computer graphics. The field of digital image processing is the study 
of algorithms for their transformation.
-> RASTER IMAGES FILE FORMATS :- JPG,PNG,BMP,GIF.

2. VECTOR IMAGE
->Vector images resulted from mathematical geometry (vector). 
-> In mathematical terms, a vector consists of both a magnitude, or length, and a direction.
-> Often, both raster and vector elements will be combined in one image; 
for example, in the case of a billboard with text (vector) and photographs (raster).
Example of vector file types are "EPS, PDF, and AI."
