-> We can import another js file inside another 
-> importing leads browser to request the js file/module from the server.
-> Importing leads to http get request.
-> Generally we don't ship this type code to browser , generally at development we write code
in seperate modules i.e at source code level but before shipping we use some kind of 
module bundler to bundle the files into single Js file that can be shipped

-> Note:- We can still ship js application without module bundler but it has some disadvantages
one is we have seen i.e "testing in local environment"
