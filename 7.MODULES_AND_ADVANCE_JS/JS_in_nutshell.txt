-> We as a developer write callbacks to user input events and change the state 
of applcaition with these callbacks
-> First when JS is parsed by browser it creates global execution context,our code 
registers all callbacks, Now GEC is deleted and JS engine event loop is waiting
for events and callbacks to be scheduled and state of application is changed 
according to this.
-> That is what frontend is all about in a nutshell.
-> Frontend-> Consuming data and giving user way to interact and manage data 
carefully by keeping performance(JANKS) in mind.
