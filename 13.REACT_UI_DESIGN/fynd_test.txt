Create a <MultipleFilters /> component that takes care of the entire page, including filters bar and products list.

When a button or a filter is clicked, the products should change. For example, if Bags are clicked, the products list should only show products that have a category of Bags.

When an already selected filter is clicked, it should remove the clicked filtered from the list of active filters.

There can be more than 1 filter at a time.

Selected filteres should have a different background color.

If no filters are selected, it should render out all the products which are provided in the items array.

Given to you is an items file that has products with name and category attributes.
