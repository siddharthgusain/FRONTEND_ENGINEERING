-> Each packet passes through various network devices , routers , gateways and
finally reaches destination machine 

-> Segmentation , fragmentation , Is being done at OSI layers respectively.

-> Server machine has its own hardware(RAM,NIC,CPU,HDD) and operating system,

-> Server can have an application process running to handle request (Backend engineering).

-> Note:- Server could have multiple layers of abstraction , right now for a frontend application ,
server takes request , process and send data response.(Frther details will be in backend Engineering).

-> We will keep server machine abstract for now , will focus more on client side(Browsers).
