-> Server machine has its own hardware(RAM,NIC,CPU,HDD) and operating system which is different OS that is present in
personal computers.

-> Server can have an application process running to handle request like nodejs or spring based application(Backend engineering).

-> Note:- Server could have multiple layers of abstraction , right now for a frontend application ,
server takes request , process and send data response.(Further details will be in backend Engineering).

-> We will keep server machine abstract for now , will focus more on client side(Browsers).
