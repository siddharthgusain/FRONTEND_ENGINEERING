-> Keys Must Only Be "Unique Among Siblings"
-> Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. 
-> However, they don’t need to be globally unique. 
-> We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays.

-> Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. 
-> If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name


Example:-
const content = posts.map((post) =>
  <Post
    key={post.id}
    id={post.id}
    title={post.title} />
);
