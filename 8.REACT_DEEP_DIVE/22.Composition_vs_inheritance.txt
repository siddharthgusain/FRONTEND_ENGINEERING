-> Composition Creating a object of some class inside another class
-> Inheritance is extending base class and creating new child class.

-> React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition 
instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

-> So What About Inheritance?
1. At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where
we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

2. Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look 
and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, 
including "primitive values, React elements, or functions".

3. If you want to reuse "non-UI functionality" between components, we suggest "extracting it into a 
separate JavaScript module". The components may import it and use that function, object, or class, 
without extending it.
