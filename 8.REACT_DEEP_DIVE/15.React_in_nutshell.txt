-> React is a library which provides you various functions and classes
-> These functions can be used to develop component and let user focus on business logic rather than rendering UI
-> React mantains its own Tree(VirtualDOM) and do the commits to actual DOM created by browser(using DOM API) by 
using a process known as Reconcilation.
-> DOM API like appendChild, createElement is used by React functions internally , "generally"
developer don't use these inside their React App.

-> Component instance(plain javscript object) is made using React.createElement() and render to parent 
using render() call

-> When state changes , again this element is constructed(React.createElement) with new state value 
and other optimization is done by react to change it into actual Browser DOM.

-> React internals will be discussed later in the sections.
