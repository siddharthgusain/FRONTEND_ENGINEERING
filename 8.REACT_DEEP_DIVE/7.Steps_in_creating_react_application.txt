1. Divide the UI carefully into managable and scalable components
2. Manage Lifecycle of a single component

-> React component is just a "plane javascript object" which are "IMMUTABLE";

-> React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children 
or attributes. 

-> An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

----------------UPDATE ONLY THAT IS NECESSARY--------------------
-> React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, 
and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
