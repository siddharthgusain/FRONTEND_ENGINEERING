-> Web storage API have two types of storages:-
1. Localstorage :- Data is stored by browser in harddisk so it remains even if we close chrome or
close the current tab, so can be deleted explicitly once stored

2. Session storage:- Data is stored in RAM i.e current process memory of renderer process , so
closing the current tab or browser removes the DATA in RAM , hence session storage doesn't 
perisist permanently

Note:- both stores data in key value pair
Two methods are used setItem and getItem
