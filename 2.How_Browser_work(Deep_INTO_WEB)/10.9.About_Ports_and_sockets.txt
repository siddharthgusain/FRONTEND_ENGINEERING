About PORTS :-
-> Ports are 16 bit number ranging from (0-65535).
-> Ports are assigned to process for uniques identification which is helpful for IPC. 
-> Applications like normal text editor don't need port number 
-> A port number specifies the process to which incoming data or
 messages arriving on a given "network interface" should be routed.
-> Some ports are well defined ports like 80,443 etc;
-> Each process has PID which is a unique identification number which is stored by 
OS in some data structure like linked list to store Process control block(PCB).

What exactly is socket ?

-> Socket is combination of IP + Port number , OS stored the information for each socket 
it is creating.
-> IP can be (v4) or (v6) version (32 bit or 128 bit)
-> Socket is just a 48 bit identifier in case of ipV4 used by OS to route the data packets
to corresponding process.
-> Socket helps in inter-process communication

Two types of sockets ->
1. For processes within same computer -> Unix domain sockets
2. For processes in different computer connected over network -> Internet/network sockets sockets
