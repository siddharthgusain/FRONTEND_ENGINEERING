-> Render blocking means anything that blocks the "main thread" of Renderer process from
painting onto the screen.
-> The reason we "defer script" loading is that javascript compilation is done on main thread 
of the renderer process by the "JS ENGINE"(JUST A PIECE OF CODE) SO, javascript execution can block
the "rendering pipeline" that we have studied in previously.
-> This will also affect FCP,LCP etc that are web vitals for SEO.
-> Also if javascript starts executing before the DOM is created in the memory,there is a possibility
that it will try to access a DOM node which is not yet created in memory.
-> NOTE:- RENDER BLOCKING RESOURCES ARE CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND ANY OTHER IMPORTS IN HTML LIKE 
FONT IMPORTS
